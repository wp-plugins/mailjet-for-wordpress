** Secure & real-time SMTP relay for all your emails **
- A lot of features and plugins from your WordPress site send email notifications. All these messages are very important for your users, as well as for your business. Therefore, you want to track success and ensure a successful delivery.

Our plugin simply extends the WordPress wp_mail() function, to use Mailjet's SMTP instead. This will improve your deliverability. You will also get live and in-depth statistics to track and optimize in real time. Making the choice of Mailjet is the right solution for your [transactional emails](http://www.mailjet.com/features/transactional-email.html) , [bulk emails](http://www.mailjet.com/features/bulk-email.html) and [newsletter emails](https://www.mailjet.com/features/newsletter-service.html).

** Sign up form & contact lists Management **
-  Another great feature of this plugin is the sign up form Widget. It allows your site visitors to join your Mailjet lists. You can create contact lists directly from the plugin dashboard. The Widget will let you add forms to any post or any page.

** Mailjet's latest generation v3 iframes **
-  Last but not least, the plugin features Mailjet's latest v3 iframes to manage contacts, create drag-and-drop marketing campaigns and view in depth sending statistics directly from within the plug-in.
